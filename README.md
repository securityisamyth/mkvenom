## mkvenom.sh

:snake: `mkvenom.sh` is a Bash script which generates a selection of Metasploit Framework `msfvenom` payloads for a given target.
The idea is to kick this off in the background while performing initial scanning and enumeration of a target during a penetration test activity to speed up your testing workflow.
